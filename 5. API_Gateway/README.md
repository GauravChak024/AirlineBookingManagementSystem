# API Gateway for Airline Booking Management System

(Acting as a MIDDLE-END)

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this incoming request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
