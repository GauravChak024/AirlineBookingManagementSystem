# AirlineBookingManagementSystem

• Follows a Microservices architectural pattern, where multiple independent services are developed.

• These services include an Authentication Service utilizing JWT, a Flights Searching Service, a Reminder Service, and a Booking Service.

• Sequelize, a robust Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, is used to interact with the MySQL database, enhancing data management and reducing complexity.

• An API Gateway is employed to handle client requests, serving as a single-entry point to the entire system. It directs incoming requests to the relevant microservices.
